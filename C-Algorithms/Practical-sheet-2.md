## **Question 1** <br/>
Have the computer print

   **HI, HOW OLD ARE YOU?**

on one line. The user then enters his or her age immediately after the question mark. The computer then skips two lines and prints on two consecutive lines.

**WELCOME (age)<br/>
LETâ€™S BE FRIENDS!**

Write a complete C program to do the above.

        int age;
        printf("HI,HOW OLD ARE YOU?");
